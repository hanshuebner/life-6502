# life-6502 - Game of Life in 6502 Assembly

It is never too late to learn how to program a 6502, and as I wanted
to have a game of life implementation on the Apple IIe and was too
lazy to find one, I tried writing my own.  I started using
https://www.masswerk.at/6502/assembler.html as my development
environment, but have now switched to
https://github.com/hanshuebner/cl-6502 as that is better suited to
larger programs.
